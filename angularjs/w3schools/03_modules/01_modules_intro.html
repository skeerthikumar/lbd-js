<!-- An AngularJS module defines an application.
The module is a container for the different parts of an application.
The module is a container for the application controllers.
Controllers always belong to a module -->
<!-- A module is created by using the AngularJS function angular.module -->

<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl">
{{ firstName + " " + lastName }}
</div>

<!-- The "myApp" parameter refers to an HTML element in which the application will run.
Now you can add controllers, directives, filters, and more, to your AngularJS application. -->

<!-- Add a controller to your application, and refer to the controller with the ng-controller directive: -->

<script>
var app = angular.module("myApp", []);
app.controller("myCtrl", function($scope) {
    $scope.firstName = "Keerthi";
    $scope.lastName = "Kumar";
});
</script>
