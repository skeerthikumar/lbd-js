<!-- AngularJS has a set of built-in directives which you can use to add functionality to your application. -->

For a full reference of build-in directives, visit <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/angular/angular_ref_directives.asp"> AngularJS directive reference.</a>

<!-- In addition you can use the module to add your own directives to your applications: -->

<div ng-app="myApp" w3-test-directive></div>

<script>
var app = angular.module("myApp", []);
app.directive("w3TestDirective", function() {
    return {
        template : "<h1>I was made in a directive constructor!</h1>"
    };
