## AngularJS Rationale And Data Binding

  * MVVM framework allows to have data-binding to various UI elements.
  * Angular JS supports both MVC and MVVM framework and hence referred as **MVW framework**
  * Framework vs Libraries FW does not require many libraries, but learning a library is faster
  ..* FW doesn't require multiple libraries, but learning single one is faster
  ..* FW has better code quality, but library bugs are easier to fix
  ..* FW enforces uniformity in code, but library allows flexibility
  ..* FW requires steep learning curve

While writing Angular codes, one has to take care of both server and client side.
For instance, AJAX content generated by server and changes in view to be taken care.

Common template engine can be used like [http://handlebarjs.com]HandleBar template.
